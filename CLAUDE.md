# Glass Editor

Novel writing desktop app with an in-app renderer chat (Claude AI) and a suite of prose analysis widgets.

## Project layout

- `src/components/` — React components (`RendererPanel.tsx` is the renderer chat handler)
- `src/lib/` — pure analysis libraries (speech-detect, chapter-analysis, repetition, prose-profile, continuity, character-voice, chapter-dna, paragraph-risk, chapter-diff, local-review)
- `scripts/` — TDD accuracy test suites (run with `npx tsx scripts/<name>.ts`)
- `src/components/widgets/` — display widgets backed by `src/lib/` modules

## Working on the codebase

Read before editing. When modifying any `src/lib/` module, check whether a TDD suite exists in `scripts/` and run it first to establish a baseline. All widget-backing libraries target ≥85% accuracy.

Run a specific suite:
```
npx tsx scripts/accuracy-suite.ts           # speech detection (DEFAULT ≥82%, HIGH ≥96%)
npx tsx scripts/scan-accuracy-suite.ts      # local scan heuristics (recall ≥70%, precision ≥80%)
npx tsx scripts/test-chapter-analysis.ts    # chapter analysis
npx tsx scripts/test-repetition.ts          # repetition detection
npx tsx scripts/test-prose-profile.ts       # prose profile (POV/tense)
npx tsx scripts/test-grammar-check.ts       # grammar check
npx tsx scripts/test-continuity-voice.ts    # continuity + voice
npx tsx scripts/test-chapter-dna.ts         # chapter DNA builder
npx tsx scripts/test-paragraph-risk.ts      # paragraph risk scoring
npx tsx scripts/test-chapter-diff.ts        # chapter diff
```

Test suites exit with code 1 if below target.

## Renderer chat commands — when to use which

The renderer chat in the app handles these slash commands. Use this decision table when the user asks about novel writing or which command to run:

| User wants to... | Command | Context mode |
|---|---|---|
| Quick prose/pattern scan (first pass, before anything else) | `/scan` | Compact — local heuristics + Claude diagnostic |
| Draft a new chapter | `/draft <N>` | Full |
| Build context packet before a complex draft | `/context <N>` | Full |
| Prose review / AI fingerprint pass | `/review <N>` | Full — includes voice, arc, neighborhood |
| World / lore consistency check | `/lore <N>` | Full — includes continuity signals |
| Assemble chapter into canon | `/assemble <N>` | Full |
| Update story artifacts after assembly | `/update <N>` | Full |
| Initialize a new novel project | `/init` | Full |

**Context rule:** `/scan` uses compact DNA (~100 tokens). All other commands use full context (~350 tokens + voice fingerprints + neighborhood context). This is automatic — do not try to override it.

**Ordering rule:** For a chapter going through the full pipeline, the correct sequence is:
`/context` → `/draft` → `/scan` → `/review` → `/lore` → `/assemble` → `/update`

`/scan` is always the first quality check after a draft exists. Do not run `/review` or `/lore` before `/scan` has been run once.

**Vague request routing:**
- "check for issues" → `/scan` (quick, cheap); escalate to `/review` if prose-level work is needed
- "review this" → `/review <N>`
- "something's wrong with the lore / world" → `/lore <N>`
- "is it ready?" → `/scan` if no scan exists; compare results against PRIMARY ≥7 gate
- "make it better" → identify which dimension is weak from scan results, then run the targeted command
